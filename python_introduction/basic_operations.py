# Instructions:

# Create a file named basic_operations.py.
# In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
# You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
# Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
# Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#calculate sum
sum = number1 + number2

#calculate the differernce
difference = number1 - number2

#calculate product
product = number1 * number2

#print the results
print("Addition of 10 and 5 is",sum)
print("Subtraction of 10 and 5 is",difference)
print("Multiplication of 10 and 5 is",product)
